# GANwriting

Implementation of [GANwriting: Content-Conditioned Generation of Styled Handwritten Word Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02567) in Pytorch.

To use with [IAM dataset](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database), download it and change *dataroot* in *main.ipynb* to your path to the dataset.

At this point, it might take some effort to train with all three objectives together.
